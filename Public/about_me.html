  My name is
  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RastaFrozeN/"> Gregory</a> and I was born in
  1991. I am in a happy relationship and have a wonderful son. My wife and I
  enjoy spending time together playing board games (

    >Terraformation Mars</a
  >
  rules), sometimes computer games (Lately I've been consumed by space missions
  in
  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/"
    >KSP</a
  >). We don't deny ourselves good movies like
  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120689/">Green Mile</a>,
  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1675434">Intouchables</a> or less
  serious titles like
  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315327">Bruce Almighty</a>. We also
  like series for example:
  <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0898266">The Big Bang Theory.</a>
</p>

<p>
  For my 30th birthday I managed to realize one of my dreams which was
  skydiving. Sensational feeling and I would like to repeat it in the future.

  I am also interested in

  >. Going on stage and making people (sometimes myself as well) laugh to tears,
  gives me really great pleasure.
